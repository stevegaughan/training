Reproducible Research 

Getting Started with Matlab and Matlab Online
Date:4/2/2024
Time:1:00pm - 2:00pm
Online:This is an online event. Event URL will be sent via registration email.
Presenter:Steve Gaughan
Categories:Reproducible Research
Data science, data analysis, and data visualization can all be done within Matlab and the browser-based Matlab Online. We'll introduce basic concepts of data science, data visualization and data analysis using Matlab software.  Matlab has toolboxes for statistics, image analysis, deep learning and more.  It has a programming language built in that can be used to automate repetitive tasks and increase the reproducibility of results using loops, conditionals and functions.

Getting Started with R and R Studio
Date:4/30/2024
Time:1:00pm - 2:00pm
Online:This is an online event. Event URL will be sent via registration email.
Presenter:Steve Gaughan
Categories:Reproducible Research

Data science, data analysis, and data visualization can all be done with R and R Studio.
We'll introduce basic concepts of R and R Studio, along with data frames and tidy data.  We'll do some exploratory data analysis and create some data visualizations.  R has a vast library of packages that greatly extend the capabilities of base R, we'll review some common R packages.  We'll discuss how R scripts can automate repetitive tasks and increase the reproducibility of results using loops, conditionals and functions.
Please make sure you have R and R Studio installed  (Helpful instructions at https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#r-1)
